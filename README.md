# MazeSolver
A maze solver that will solve a given maze

Project was inspired by the Youtube Channel - Codephile : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI
This project expands on his application of the Bredth First Search Algorithm towards mazes of various shapes/sizes.

Goals of this Project:
  -Application of BFS Algorithm [ ]
  -Application of DFS Algorithm [ ]
  -Visual Representation of Solved Maze Pathway [ ]
  -Timer Function to compare Algorithms [ ]
  -Application to Orthoganal Mazes [ ]
  -Application to Circular Mazes [ ]
  
Optional:
  -Application to Triangular Mazes [ ]
  -Application to Hexagonal Mazes [ ]
  

The mazes were generated using a third party program called Daedalus: www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm
The program has ben extracted and put inside the directory: ".../src/res/Daedalus"
This program DOES NOT belong to me; however it has been used to generate the pixelized mazes that will be inserted to
test cases and solve mazes. For more information regarding Daedalus and its usage, plase go to their site as I had 
posted above.

If you have any questions or regards feel free to contact me via e-mail.

This README.txt will be updated as the project continues...
