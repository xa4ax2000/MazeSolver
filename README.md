# MazeSolver
A maze solver that will solve a given maze

Project was inspired by the Youtube Channel - Codephile : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI
This project expands on his application of the Bredth First Search Algorithm towards mazes of various shapes/sizes.

Goals of this Project:
  -Application of BFS Algorithm [ ]
  -Application of DFS Algorithm [ ]
  -Visual Representation of Solved Maze Pathway [ ]
  -Timer Function to compare Algorithms [ ]
  -Application to Orthoganal Mazes [ ]
  -Application to Circular Mazes [ ]
  
Optional:
  -Application to Triangular Mazes [ ]
  -Application to Hexagonal Mazes [ ]


This README.txt will be updated as the project continues...
